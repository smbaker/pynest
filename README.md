 Usage:
    'nest.py help' will tell you what to do and how to do it

 Example:
    'nest.py --user joe@user.com --password swordfish temp 73'
         set the temperature to 73 degrees

    'nest.py --user joe@user.com --password swordfish fan auto'
         set the fan to automatic

 Installation:
    'python ./setup.py install' will install nest.py to the right place,
    usually your /usr/bin directory.
